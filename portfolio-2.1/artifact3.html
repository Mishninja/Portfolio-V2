                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>I was approached by a friend working for a small start up to design a set of icons.  The company was under the process of redesigning a webpage and needed new icons. I was given a color palette and prompts to design for.  I set to work creating sketches on paper first, and then moved into Adobe Illustrator to create my final products. I went through several iterations of designs as I was continously in contact with the marketing manager.</p>

                                <h3>Reference Material</h3>
                                <p>These were the resources I was given to begin the project.  The client wanted icons similar to the ones displayed above.  They were looking for simple, clean, but able to communicate their message.  Their color palette was very simple, and I was given the creative freedom to add additional colors.  However, I chose to stick closely with what they had given me, but used tints of their company colors to expand the palette I could work with.</p>

                                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                                <p>I first sketched out the general idea of the icons on paper.  After some research on icons and international symbols, I generated the above.  I tried to make sure the icons were effectively communicating the prompt while keeping them simple.</p>

                                <h3>Iteration 1</h3>
                                <p>These were the firsts iteration of icons that I came up with.  I took my sketches into Adobe Illustrator and implemented them.  I also added more detail to them to make the icons more explicit.  The client asked for pastel tones for a more friendly and inviting look.  I used tints of their company colors (red, blue and orange) and gradients to achieve this effect.  I also used an irregular shape for the background to emulate the reference icons they provided for me. </p>
                                <p>After the first iteration, the client then asked for the backgrounds to be circular and for the gradients to be taken
                                out.</p>

                                <h3>Iteration 2</h3>
                                <p>After changing the backgrounds to circles and flat colors, I ended up with these icons.  The icons turned out to look too light while using pastel colors.  I brought up the issue of contrast on a website, but still followed their request to use pastel and soft colors. After another email exchange, they agreed that pastel colors were not the way to go. </p>

                                <h3>Iteration 3</h3>
                                <p>These are the final icons.  I used a solid background as requested, and increased the tints on all the colors to make the icons more bold. This subtle change made the icons more eyecatching and made them easier to view on the website.</p>
