                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>This was a small personal project that spawned from the need for a place to keep all my commonly made recipes in
                        an easily accessible place. I also implemented a mobile first approach to make the recipes easy to view on your
                        phone and to share with friends and family. I wanted to create an interface that was simple and straightforward
                        to use, so I decided to create a card layout with a modal that would pop up when a card was clicked on.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to implement a modal because it would allow users to easily browse the recipes without having to be
                        redirected to a separate page, then coming back and having to scroll the last recipe they clicked on. The page
                        and functionality were accomplished using HTML, CSS, Pure framework and JavaScript. Continue scrolling to find
                        out how I implemented this project.

                                <h3>Layout</h3>
                                <p>I created simple card layout using HTML and CSS to display the recipes that are available.  The card layout features a photo, the title of the recipe, the time it takes to make the recipe, and how many units the recipe yields.  A card layout made the most sense because it provides the scannable information for users to look at to manage user expectation. The responsive grid layout of the cards was accomplished using the Pure grid framework.  </p>

                                <h3>Modal</h3>
                                <p>The modal was created using CSS and JavaScript.  All the modals are existing HTML elements that have the CSS attribute “display: none”.  I first mapped out how I wanted the recipe information to be displayed on the modal, then created new elements for each individual recipe.  </p>
                                <p>In the future, as my recipe collection grows, I would likely generate the modals dynamically and create a database of recipes.  However, for the purposes of this small project, I was able to get away with creating the recipe modals as existing HTML elements.  </p>

                                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                                <p>The recipe cards are linked to a modal using a custom data attribute “data-card” where it contains the recipe modal’s id.  The recipe cards are continuously listening for a click event.  When users click on a specific card, the “data-card” attribute, the modal with the id that matches the attribute will be retrieved and it’s display value will be changed to “block”.  This will allow the modal to be displayed and the recipe to be read.</p>
                                <p>Users can close the modal by clicking the “X” in the top right corner, or they may click anywhere off the modal.</p>

                                <h3>Mobile Responsive</h3>
                                <p>The website was designed using a mobile first approach. As many people access recipes online from their
                                    phones while they cook or bake, making the page mobile first was a must. All font sizes, and recipe layouts
                                    were made to be optimized for different device viewport widths.</p>
                                <p>As mentioned before, the card layout is made responsive using the Pure framework. The modals also vary in
                                    font size and text layout that are optimal for each device viewport width.</p>
