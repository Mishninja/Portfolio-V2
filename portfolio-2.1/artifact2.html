                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of this exercise was to create a logo and stationery set for a fictional brand.  The brand I came up with is Zhang Jewelers, which is a fictional jewelry company that would specialize in quality and reasonably priced engagement rings and other jewelry pieces.  Scroll through the gallery below to learn more about my process, and to see the final products.</p>

                                <h3>Mood board and Color Scheme</h3>
                                <p>First, I created a mood board and a color scheme. Typically, a client would give their input at this stage,
                                    however, I had creative freedom because this is a fictional brand.</p>
                                <p>I chose to go with a complementary color scheme for a bold and fun look. I chose a deep jade green shade
                                    because jade in Chinese culture has great significance. Moreover, the color is elegant and sophisticated
                                    which establishes a sense of quality and credibility for a jewelry brand. I chose a light pink as a
                                    complementary shade to lighten the moodiness of the green and convey a sense of delicate-ness.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="panel row-rev">
                            <div class="img">
                                <img src="images/a2/02.png" alt="">
                            </div>

                                <h3>Logo and Graphics</h3>
                                <p>I created the logo in Adobe Illustrator using the color scheme I had produced with the mood board. The brand
                                    logo is modeled after Chinese calligraphy. I simply traced the character from a reference photo in
                                    Illustrator using the pen tool, to create a vector.</p>
                                <p>The graphics are meant to represent flower petals, keeping with the delicate-ness and elegant theme. I
                                    created these graphics using the pattern tool in Illustrator. This allowed me to use the pattern within any
                                    shape that I wanted, allowing me to easily apply it on the stationery</p>

                        </div>

                                <h3>Thumbnails</h3>
                                <p>I sketched a series of thumbnails for each of the pieces of stationery to be designed. The sketches allowed
                                    me to explore potential layouts. For example, I experimented with vertical and horizontal page orientations
                                    for the envelope and business cards.</p>

                                <h3>Roughs</h3>
                                <p>After creating thumbnails I took elements I liked from each one and incorporated them into slightly more
                                    detailed sketches. I included details such as the graphics and logo placements, as well as text placement.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Envelope</h3>
                                <p>For the envelope, I designed both front and back to post office standards. I left the front relatively empty
                                    to leave space to write an address and for a stamp. The back side has the return address and the same
                                    graphics for some cohesiveness.</p>

                                <h3>Letterhead</h3>
                                <p>The letterhead features a bar on the left-hand side for company information and logo. I used the flower petal
                                    graphics to separate the logo and the company information, adding some visual interest and separating
                                    information accordingly. Plenty of space was right on the right for actual content.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Business Card</h3>
                                <p>The business card also has the same petal graphics on the front to be cohesive with the rest of the parts.
                                    The back of the card is reserved for information, so I used a simple diagonal line to reflect the front
                                    design but also to separate information and give it some hierarchy.</p>
